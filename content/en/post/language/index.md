C++ (pronounced c-plus-plus) is a compiled, statically typed, general-purpose programming language.

Supports such programming paradigms as procedural programming, object-oriented programming, generic programming. The language has a rich standard library that includes common containers and algorithms, I/O, regular expressions, multithreading support, and more. C++ combines features of both high-level and low-level languages. In comparison with its predecessor - the C language - the greatest attention is paid to support for object-oriented and generic programming.

C++ is widely used for software development, being one of the most popular programming languages. Its scope includes the creation of operating systems, various application programs, device drivers, applications for embedded systems, high-performance servers, and computer games. There are many implementations of the C++ language, both free and commercial, and for various platforms. For example, on the x86 platform, these are GCC, Visual C++, Intel C++ Compiler, Embarcadero (Borland) C++ Builder, and others. C++ has had a huge impact on other programming languages, most notably Java and C#.

The syntax of C++ is inherited from the C language. Originally, one of the design principles was to maintain compatibility with C. However, C++ is not strictly a superset of C; The set of programs that can be translated equally well by both C and C++ compilers is quite large, but does not include all possible C programs.
